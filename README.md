A package written in Python for manipulating Illumina generated FastQ files. This code
is based on best practices developed and maintained at St. Jude Children's Research
Hospital. We only consider files which meet the following criteria:

* FastQ files (no support for Fasta)
* Illumina generated
* "Lazy" FastQ file structure (4 lines per read)

Anyone is welcome to contribute code or create issues.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

If you are only interested in the command line tools, you can run the following
commands to get access to them:

```bash
pip install fqlib
fqlint
```

### Prerequisites

* Insure that Python 3.6+ is installed on your machine. `fqlib` may work with earlier versions of Python, but that would be coincidental.


### Installing

To get a full install of `fqlib` on your machine, you can run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stjude/fqlib.git
cd fqlib
pip install -r requirements.txt
make install
```

## Development

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stjude/fqlib.svg?branch=development)](https://travis-ci.org/stjude/fqlib)


You can get a development version of the package and link it into your local Python installation like so:

```bash
git clone -b development https://github.com/stjude/fqlib.git
cd fqlib
pip install -r requirements.txt
make develop
```

### Running the tests

You can run the tests by running the following command. We are actively improving the test coverage.

```
make tests
```
