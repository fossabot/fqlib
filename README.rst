fqlib
=====

:code:`fqlib` is a package written in Python for manipulating Illumina generated FastQ files. This code
is based on best practices developed and maintained at St. Jude Children's Research
Hospital. We only consider files which meet the following criteria:

* FastQ files (no support for Fasta)
* Illumina generated
* "Lazy" FastQ file structure (4 lines per read)

Anyone is welcome to contribute code or create issues.

Getting Started
---------------

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

If you are only interested in the command line tools, you can run the following
commands to get access to them:

.. code-block:: bash
   :linenos:

   pip install fqlib
   fqlint

Prerequisites
+++++++++++++

* Insure that Python 3.6+ is installed on your machine. `fqlib` may work with earlier versions of Python, but that would be coincidental.

Installing
++++++++++

To get a full install of `fqlib` on your machine, you can run the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash
   :linenos:

   git clone https://github.com/stjude/fqlib.git
   cd fqlib
   python setup.py install

Running the tests
-----------------

No unit tests exist today, but we are working towards implementing them.
